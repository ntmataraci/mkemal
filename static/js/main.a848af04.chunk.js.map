A short time before Italy declared war, \r\n    many of the Ottoman troops in Libya were sent to the Ottoman province of Yemen Vilayet to put down the rebellion there,\r\n     so the Ottoman government was caught with inadequate resources to counter the Italians in Libya. \r\n     Britain, which controlled the Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan, did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. \r\n     Ottoman soldiers like Atatürk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt)\r\n      or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). \r\n      However, despite all the hardships, Atatürk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions,\r\n       such as at the Battle of Tobruk on 22 December 1911.\r\n    During the Battle of Derna on 16–17 January 1912, while Atatürk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-ı Harun,\r\n     two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a limestone splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atatürk's left eye, \r\n     causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month;\r\n      he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened,\r\n       he had to return and resume treatment.

In early 1938, while on a trip to Yalova, he suffered from a serious illness. He went to Istanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with cirrhosis. During his stay in Istanbul, he made an effort to keep up with his regular lifestyle, but eventually succumbed to his illness. He died on 10 November 1938, at the age of 57, in the Dolmabahçe Palace. He was the first president of Turkey to die in office.[262] The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to the time of his death, 9:05 in the morning.[citation needed][dubious – discuss]\r\n\r\n    Atatürk's funeral called forth both sorrow and pride in Turkey, and 17 countries sent special representatives, while nine contributed armed detachments to the cortège.[181] Atatürk's remains were originally laid to rest in the Ethnography Museum of Ankara, but they were transferred on 10 November 1953 (15 years after his death) in a 42-ton sarcophagus to a mausoleum overlooking Ankara, Anıtkabir.[263]\r\n    \r\n    In his will, Atatürk donated all of his possessions to the Republican People's Party, provided that the yearly interest of his funds[264] would be used to look after his sister Makbule and his adopted children, and fund the higher education of İsmet İnönü's children.[265] The remainder was willed to the Turkish Language Association and the Turkish Historical Society.[266][265] `,\r\n    \"image\":[\"./img/13/1.jpg\",\"./img/13/2.jpg\",\"./img/13/3.jpg\",\"./img/13/4.jpg\",\"./img/13/5.jpg\",\"./img/13/6.jpg\"]\r\n},\r\n]\r\n\r\n","import style from \"./FrontScreen.module.css\";\r\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport { Data } from \"./Data\";\r\nconst FrontScreen = (props) => {\r\n  const closeContent = () => {\r\n    props.receiveClose();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const [photoId, setPhotoId] = useState(Data[props.sendData].image[0]);\r\n const [zoomExist,setZoomExist]=useState(false)\r\n\r\n const zoom = (x) =>{\r\n     setZoomExist(x)\r\n }\r\n\r\n  const changePhoto = (item) => {\r\n    setPhotoId(item.target.src);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const fetchingData = Data[props.sendData].content;\r\n  const fetchingImages = Data[props.sendData].image;\r\n\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className={style.TransparentBackground}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={style.FrontScreen}>\r\n        <div className={style.close} onClick={closeContent}>\r\n          X\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className={style.text}>\r\n          <div className={style.outside}>\r\n            <img\r\n              className={style.image}\r\n              src={photoId}\r\n              width=\"150\"\r\n              height=\"150\"\r\n             onClick={()=>zoom(true)}\r\n            />\r\n          </div>\r\n          {fetchingData}\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className={style.bottom}>\r\n          {fetchingImages.map((item) => (\r\n            <img\r\n              src={item}\r\n              width=\"100\"\r\n              height=\"100\"\r\n              onClick={(item) => changePhoto(item)}\r\n            />\r\n          ))}\r\n        </div>\r\n    {zoomExist&&<div className={style.zoomedScreen}>\r\n          <img src={photoId} />\r\n          <div className={style.close} onClick={()=>zoom(false)}>\r\n            X\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div> }\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default FrontScreen;\r\n","\r\n\r\nconst Music = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div style={{width:\"100%\",textAlign:\" center\",overflow:\"hidden\"}}>\r\n        <iframe  width=\"1200\" height=\"35\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mAWAw2tbpQ?autoplay=1&mute=0\" enablejsapi=\"1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
